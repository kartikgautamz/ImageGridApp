# 3x3 Image Grid Scroller

This SwiftUI app displays a 3x3 grid of images that loads smoothly with lazy loading animation. It leverages SwiftUIâ€™s `LazyVGrid` and `AsyncImage` to efficiently load images from URLs. The grid layout is scrollable, allowing you to easily view more images in a visually appealing format.

## Features

- **3x3 Grid Layout**: Images are displayed in a neat 3x3 grid format.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images load as they come into view, saving memory and improving app performance.
- **Smooth Animation**: Includes loading indicators and error handling, with a fallback icon for failed image loads.
